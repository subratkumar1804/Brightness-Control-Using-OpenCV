# Brightness-Control-Using-OpenCV

The Brightness Control With Hand Detection OpenCV Python With Source Code was developed using Python OpenCV, This Python OpenCV Project With Source Code we are going Building a Brightness Controller with OpenCV , To change the brightness of a computer.


Building a Brightness Controller with OpenCV can be accomplished in just 3 simple steps:

<p>Step 1. Detect Hand landmarks</p>
<p>Step 2. Calculate the distance between thumb tip and index finger tip.</p>
<p>Step 3. Map the distance of thumb tip and index finger tip with volume range. For my case, distance between thumb tip and index finger tip was within the range of 15 – 220 and the volume range was from 0 – 100.</p>

OpenCV is short for Open Source Computer Vision. Intuitively by the name, it is an open-source Computer Vision and Machine Learning library. This library is capable of processing real-time image and video while also boasting analytical capabilities. It supports the Deep Learning frameworks.


To start executing Brightness Control With Hand Detection OpenCV Python With Source Code, make sure that you have installed Python 3.9 and PyCharm in your computer.
